# First-Reposit
first exercise to create a repository

It looks like I can use this README file to keep notes on what I am trying to accomplish. Great for documenting as I go. It seems each project (code for program?) would have a repository, and the branches are a means to develop code by making trial changes before committing them permanenetly to the project I'm creating.  I'm not sure that my very old-school terminology will apply to this new world.
